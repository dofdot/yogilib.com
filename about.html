        <p>योगी नरहरिनाथ (१९७१-२०५९) नेपालका एक अध्यात्मिक व्यक्ति थिए। उनी
        नेपालका उद्भट आध्यात्मिक व्यक्तित्वका रूपमा परिचित छन्। वेद, वेदान्त,
        इतिहास, पुरातत्त्व, पुराण जस्ता अति गहन विषयहरूका ज्ञाता, प्रकान्ड
        विद्वान् योगी आजीवन अन्वेषकका रूपमा रहेको पाइन्छ। देश एवं विदेशका धेरै
        ऎतिहासिक तथा पुरातात्त्विक स्थानहरूको भ्रमण गरेर उनले अध्ययन अनुसन्धान
        गरेका छन्। त्यस बाहेक उनी एक कुशल साहित्य सर्जक पनि हुन्। सिद्धहस्त आषु
        कविका रूपमा पनि परिचित उनी नेपालका आध्यात्मिक व्यक्तिहरूमध्ये एक हुन्।
        संस्कृत हिन्दी र नेपाली भाषामा रचित योगी नरहरिनाथका केही कृतिहरू (योगी
        नरहरिनाथ स्मृतिग्रन्थ, २०६८ : १३५) प्रकाशित छन् भने धेरैजसो अप्रकाशित
        छन्। घण्टौंसम्म कवितामय संस्कृतमा धाराप्रवाह प्रवचन गर्ने योगीका निमित्त
        बसेर कविता लेख्नु सामान्य कुरा थियो।</p>
