        <h1>Memorandum for the Approval and Acceptance of the Rajah of Gorkha, Presented on the 8th December 1816.</h1></hq>
        <i>— Sandhi Patra Sangraha, Yogi Narharinath and Narendraman Basnyat.
        Some obvious edits added.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        1. Adverting to the amity and Confidence subsisting with the Rajah
        of Nipaul the British Government proposes to supress as much as is
        possible, the execution of certain articles in the treaty of segowlee,
        which bear hard upon the Rajah, as follows :-</li>
        <br>
        2. With a view to gratify the Rajah in a point he has much at heart
        the British Government is willing to restore the Tarai ceded to it by
        the Rajah in the Treaty, the whole Tarai lands lying between the river
        Coosah and Gunduck, such as appertained to the Rajah before the late
        disagreement. Excepting the disputed lands in the zillahs of Tirhoot and
        Sarun, and excepting such portions of territory as may occur on both
        sides for the purpose of settling a frontier, upon investigation by the
        respective commissiones and excepting such lands as may have been given
        in possession to any one by the british Government upon ascertainment of
        this rights subsequent to the cession of Tarai to that Government. In
        case the Rajah is desirous of retaining the lands of such ascertained
        proprietors, they may be exchanged for others, and let it be clearly
        understood that, notwithstanding the considerable extent of the lands in
        the Zillah of Tirhoot, which have for a long time been a subject of
        dispute, the settlement made in the year 1812 of christ, Corresponding
        with the year 1869 of Bikramajeet, shall be taken and every thing else
        relinquished, that is to say, that the settlement and negotiations, such
        as occured at that period, shall in the present case hold good and be
        established.
        <br>
        3. The British Government is willing likewise to restore the tarai
        lying between the Rivers Gunduck and Rapti, that is to say, from the
        River Gunduck to the western limits of the zillah of Goruckpore,
        together with Bootwal and Sheoraj such as appertained to Nipaul previous
        to the disagreements, Complete, with the exception of the disputed
        places in the Tarai and such quantity of ground as may be Considered
        mutually to be requisite for the new boundary.</li>
        <br>
        4. As it is impossible to establish desirable limits between the two
        states without survey, it will be expedient that Commissioners be
        appointed on both sides for the purpose of the preceding terms, and
        establishing a straight line of frontier, with a view to the distinct
        separation of the respective territories of the British Government to
        the south and of Nipal to the North; and in case any identations occur
        to destroy even tenor of the line, the Commissioners should effect and
        exchange of lands so interfering on principle of clear reciprocity.</li>
        <br>
        5. And should it occur that the propritors of lands, situated on the
        mutual frontier, as it may be rectified , whether holding of the British
        Government or of the Rajah of Nipaul, should be placed in the condition
        of subjects to both Governments, with a view to prevent continual
        dispute and discussion between the two governments, the respective
        commissioners should effect in mutual concurrence and co-operation, the
        exchange of such lands so as to render them subject to one dominion
        alone.
        <br>
        6. Whensoever the Terai should be restored, the Rajah of Nipal will
        cease to acquire the sum of two lakhs of Rupees per annum, which the
        British Government had agreed the advance for the maintenance of certain
        Bharadars of the Government.</li>
        <br>
        7. Moreover the Rajah of Nipal agrees to refrain from prosecuting
        any inhabitants of the Terai after its revertance to his rule, on
        account of having favoured the cause of the British Government during
        the war, and should any of those persons excepting the cultivators of
        the soil, be desirous of quitting their estates, and of retiring within
        the company’s territories, he shall not be liable to hindrance.</li>
        <br>
        8. In the event of the Rajah’s approving the foregoing terms, the
        proposed arrangement for the survey and establishment of boundary—marks
        shall be carried into execution, and after the determination in concert
        of the boundary line, Sunnuds conformable to the foregoing stipulations,
        drawn out and sealed by the two states shall be delivered and accepted
        on both sides.
