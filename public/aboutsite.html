            <a href="../index.html" id="back-button"><<<<</a>
            <p>Yogilib exists to contain historical documents, treaties,
            records, manuscripts, letters and everything else pertaining to
            Nepal. I dedicate this site to the memory of <b>Yogi Narharinath</b> for
            Nepali history and culture is incomplete without his work. 
            
            <p>This site
            is run by an individual and not an institution, sponsored by the
            individual and other individuals on a strict contribute <em>whenever you
            want, how much you want </em> basis. </p>

            <p>This site would not be possible without <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYCK-FR0yq4">Govinda
            Kafle.</a> It is his mission that I am continuing here. His bhakti
            towards the Yogi that has now shown the world, the extent of a
            ahistriocity that can permeate the <em>jana</em>. This site exists
            because of <b>Govinda Kafle.</b> </p>

            <h3>On information management.</h3>

            <p>I had a few handwritten documents by the Yogi which included the
            list of all of his works and a <em>sandhi-patra-sangraha.</em> I
            have decided to transcribe the works and dedicate this place on the
            internet for those and other documents. This resource needs to congregate
            and establish itself as a store of knowledge .</p>

            <p>Currently, everything is being worked on in HTML/CSS. A backend for
            storing original files is the next step.</p>
